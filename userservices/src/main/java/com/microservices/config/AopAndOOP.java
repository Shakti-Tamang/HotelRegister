//    Sure! Let's break it down into simpler terms:
//the are different from business logic like logger
//    Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
//    OOP is a way of designing software where you organize your code into objects (which are instances of classes). These objects contain data and the actions (methods) that can be performed on the data.
//    In OOP, the main unit of design is the class, and it is where the logic and data related to an object are stored.
//    Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)
//    AOP is a programming approach that allows you to separate concerns (i.e., functionalities that are not specific to the core logic of the application but affect multiple parts of it).
//    Aspects in AOP are used to handle these concerns, like logging, security, transaction management, etc.
//    These concerns are often called crosscutting concerns because they affect multiple parts of the application. For example, logging every time a method is called might be required across many classes.
//    Key Differences
//    In OOP, you focus on classes and objects. You define how data and methods are organized inside a class.
//    In AOP, the focus is on aspects that handle tasks that cross multiple classes (like logging or transactions). So, instead of writing logging code in every class, you define an aspect that handles logging for you.
//    Spring and AOP
//    Spring is a framework that uses both OOP and AOP.
//    The Spring framework provides AOP support to handle these crosscutting concerns like transactions or security without you having to put the same code in every method or class.
//    So, for example, if you wanted to add logging to every method in your application, rather than adding System.out.println in each method, you would define a logging aspect in Spring. This aspect would automatically apply logging to every method, without modifying the core logic of your program.
//
//    In Summary:
//    OOP organizes code into classes (data + methods).
//    AOP organizes code into aspects (crosscutting concerns like logging or transactions).
//    Spring AOP helps you apply these concerns across multiple classes in a clean and modular way, allowing you to focus on the core logic while AOP handles additional tasks.
//    Does that make it clearer? Let me know if you need more details!
