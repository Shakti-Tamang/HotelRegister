//    The Circuit Breaker Pattern in Java is used to handle failures gracefully in a distributed
//    system. It works by wrapping a method call with logic that detects failures and temporarily
//    blocks (opens the circuit) further calls to the failing service until it's healthy again. If
//    calls succeed after a cooldown, the circuit "closes" to resume normal operation. This helps
//    avoid cascading failures and improves system resilience.
